========================

Avnet software libraries, project build scripts, and example source code used in Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials, board support packages, and product demos.


Current Tools Version:
----------------------
* **Xilinx PetaLinux Tools**: [PetaLinux 2017.2]


Where can I find documentation?
------------------------------- 

This repository is intended to provide publicly accessible, revision controlled source code for Avnet Reference Designs/Tutorials.

The best way to find what you are looking for would be to start with the documentation for the Reference Design/Tutorial you are interested in.  If you cannot find a document that covers the piece of code you are interested in, then it is likely that code is no longer supported.

For a list of Reference Designs/Tutorials for your Avnet board, please visit the corresponding product page for your board and then click on the **Support Files & Downloads** OR **Reference Design/Tutorials** link.


Where can I get support?
------------------------

For design support please contact your local Avnet FAE or visit one of our support forums:
