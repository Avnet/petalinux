BOOT METHODS:

1- Boot from JTAG
    Position the BOOT Switch SW3 on the board to "JTAG" mode.
    Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders, a kernel with a minimal INITRD.

2- Boot from SD card (u-boot, minimal kernel & INITRD):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition.

    Copy ./BOOT_INITRD.BIN (as BOOT.BIN), ./image_INITRD.ub (as image.ub) and ./images/linux/boot.scr on the root folder of the partition.

    Position the BOOT Switch SW3 on the board to "SD" mode.

3- Boot from SD card (u-boot, kernel & EXT4 rootfs):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition and an EXT4 partition.

    Copy ./BOOT_EXT4.BIN (as BOOT.BIN), ./image_EXT4.ub (as image.ub) and ./images/linux/boot.scr on the root folder of the 1st partition (FAT).

    Extract the rootfs inside the 2nd partition (EXT4)
    For example:
    sudo tar -xvf ./images/linux/rootfs.tar.gz -C /mount-point-of-2nd-part/

    Position the BOOT Switch SW3 on the board to "SD" mode.
