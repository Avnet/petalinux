BOOT METHODS:

1- Boot from SD card (u-boot, minimal kernel & INITRD):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition.

    Copy the following files to the root folder of the FAT partition:
        ./BOOT_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.BIN (as BOOT.BIN)
        ./image_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.ub (as image.ub) 
        ./images/linux/boot.scr 

    Position the BOOT Switch SW3 on the board to "SD" mode.

2- Boot from SD card (u-boot, kernel & EXT4 rootfs):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition and an EXT4 partition.

    Copy the following files to the root folder of the FAT partition:
        ./BOOT_EXT4.BIN (as BOOT.BIN)
        ./image_EXT4.ub (as image.ub) 
        ./images/linux/boot.scr 

    Extract the rootfs inside the 2nd partition (EXT4)
    For example:
    sudo tar -xvf ./images/linux/rootfs.tar.gz -C /mount-point-of-2nd-part/

    Position the BOOT Switch SW3 on the board to "SD" mode.
