Generate the bsp (with script make_mz....sh) and navigate into the newly-created project.

BOOT METHODS:

1- Boot from JTAG(u-boot, kernel & minimal INITRD):

    Connect the external JTAG cable.
    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2).
    Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_INITRD_MINIMAL.tcl' to load the FSBL, bitstream, u-boot, 
    and kernel with INITRD.

2- Boot from JTAG + tftp

    method a: static IP

        Connect the external JTAG cable.
        Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode:
        (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)

        Copy image_INITRD_MINIMAL.ub in /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

        Connect the board and your computer with an Ethernet cable.
        Setup your computer's IP address to 192.168.1.2.

        Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_INITRD.tcl' to load the FSBL, bitstream, and u-boot. 
        Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with minimal INITRD) from your computer.

    method b: DHCP

        Connect the external JTAG cable.
        Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode:
        (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)
        Connect the board to your network with an Ethernet cable.

        Run 'sh boot_jtag_tftp_dhcp_INITRD.sh <FULL | MINIMAL>' shell script to perform the following commands:
            1. Copy image_INITRD_$IMAGE.ub to /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

            2. Run 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh TFTP_SERVER_IP' 
               where TFTP_SERVER_IP is the IP address of your tftp server ($ hostname -I)
               -> for example: 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh 192.168.0.125'

            3. Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_dhcp_INITRD.tcl' to load the FSBL, bitstream, and u-boot. 
               Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with INITRD) from your computer.

3- Boot from SD (u-boot, kernel & INITRD):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition.  
    
    Copy the following files to the root folder of the FAT partition:
        ./BOOT_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.BIN (as BOOT.BIN)
        ./image_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.ub (as image.ub) 
        ./images/linux/boot.scr 

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the SD mode:
    (JP3 and JP2 to position 2-3, JP1 to position 1-2)

4- Boot from SD (u-boot, kernel & Ext4 rootfs):

    Write 'rootfs.wic' on an sd card with command : 
    $ sudo dd if=./rootfs.wic of=/dev/mmcblk0

    Then you can resize the 2nd partition (ext4) to fill the SD card with 
    gparted or parted & resize2fs.

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the SD mode:
    (JP3 and JP2 to position 2-3, JP1 to position 1-2)  

5- Boot from QSPI (u-boot, kernel & INITRD):

    Connect the external JTAG cable.
    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode:
    (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)
    sh boot_qspi_INITRD_MINIMAL.sh

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the QSPI mode:
    (JP3 to position 2-3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)
    Restart the board, and Linux should boot from qspi.
