BOOT METHODS:

1- Boot from JTAG

    Connect the external JTAG cable.
    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2).
    Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders, a kernel with INITRD.

2- Boot from JTAG + tftp

    method a: static IP

        Connect the external JTAG cable.
        Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2).

        Copy image_INITRD.ub in /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

        Connect the board and your computer with an Ethernet cable.
        Setup your computer's IP address to 192.168.1.2.

        Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders. Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with minimal INITRD) from your computer.

    method b: DHCP

        Connect the external JTAG cable.
        Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2).

        Copy image_INITRD.ub in /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

        Connect the board to your network with an Ethernet cable.

        Run 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh TFTP_SERVER_IP' with TFTP_SERVER_IP your tftp server ip (likely the IP of your computer)
            -> for example: 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh 192.168.0.125'

        Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_dhcp_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders. Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with INITRD) from your computer.

3- Boot from QSPI (u-boot, kernel & INITRD):

    Connect the external JTAG cable.
    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the JTAG mode (JP3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)
    sh boot_qspi_INITRD.sh

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the QSPI mode (JP3 to position 2-3, JP2 and JP1 to position 1-2)
    Restart the board, and Linux should boot from qspi.

4- Boot from SD (u-boot, kernel & INITRD):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition.

    Copy ./BOOT_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.BIN (as BOOT.BIN), ./image_INITRD_<FULL | MINIMAL>.ub (as image.ub) and ./images/linux/boot.scr on the root folder of the partition.

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the SD mode (JP3 and JP2 to position 2-3, JP1 to position 1-2)

5- Boot from SD (u-boot, kernel & Ext4 rootfs):

    Write 'rootfs.wic' on an sd card with command : sudo dd if=./rootfs.wic of=/dev/mmcblk0

    Then you can resize the 2nd partition (ext4) to fill the SD card with gparted or parted & resize2fs.

    Position the BOOT Jumpers on the board to the SD mode (JP3 and JP2 to position 2-3, JP1 to position 1-2)
