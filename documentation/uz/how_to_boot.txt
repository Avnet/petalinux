BOOT METHODS:

1- Boot from JTAG + tftp

    method a: static IP

        Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "JTAG" mode.

        Copy image_INITRD.ub in /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

        Connect the board and your computer with an Ethernet cable.
        Setup your computer's IP address to 192.168.1.2.

        Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders. Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with minimal INITRD) from your computer.

    method b: DHCP

        Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "JTAG" mode.

        Copy image_INITRD.ub in /tftpboot folder as image.ub.

        Connect the board to your network with an Ethernet cable.

        Run 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh TFTP_SERVER_IP' with TFTP_SERVER_IP your tftp server ip (likely the IP of your computer)
            -> for example: 'sh create_dhcp_boot_scr.sh 192.168.0.125'

        Run 'xsdb boot_jtag_tftp_dhcp_INITRD.tcl' to load the bitstream, the bootloaders. Then u-boot will use TFTP to load the kernel (with INITRD) from your computer.

2- Boot from SD card (u-boot, minimal kernel & INITRD):

    Prepare an SD card with a FAT partition.

    Copy ./BOOT_INITRD.BIN (as BOOT.BIN), ./image_INITRD.ub (as image.ub) and ./images/linux/boot.scr on the root folder of the partition.

    Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "SD1" mode.

3- Boot from SD card (u-boot, kernel & EXT4 rootfs):

    Write 'rootfs.wic' on an sd card with command : sudo dd if=./rootfs.wic of=/dev/mmcblk0

    Then you can resize the 2nd partition (ext4) to fill the SD card with gparted or parted & resize2fs.

    Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "SD1" mode.

4- Boot from eMMC FAT32 (u-boot & kernel) + eMMC EXT4 (rootfs):

    Copy 'rootfs.wic' on an SD card

    Boot Linux from method 1 or 2.

    In Linux, execute these commands:

        umount /dev/mmcblk0*
        dd if=/media/sd-mmcblk1p1/rootfs.wic of=/dev/mmcblk0

        umount /dev/mmcblk0*
        parted /dev/mmcblk0 resizepart 2 100%
        umount /dev/mmcblk0*
        e2fsck -f /dev/mmcblk0p2
        resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

        umount /dev/mmcblk1*
        Remove the sd card from the board

    Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "EMMC" mode.

    Reboot the board, and let u-boot automatically load the kernel on the EMMC.

5- Boot from QSPI (u-boot) + eMMC FAT32 (kernel) + eMMC EXT4 (rootfs):

    After having done the emmc partitioning from method 4, position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "JTAG" mode.

    Then to install the bootloaders on the qspi, run the command:

        program_flash -f ./BOOT_INITRD_MINIMAL.BIN -offset 0 -flash_type qspi_dual_parallel -fsbl ./images/linux/zynqmp_fsbl.elf

    Position the BOOT Switch SW2 on the board to "QSPI" mode.

    Reboot the board. The board will load u-boot from the qspi and then fetch the kernel from emmc
